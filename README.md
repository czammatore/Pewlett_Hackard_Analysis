## Analysis Overview and Findings

In our analysis, we looked at two distinct groups of employees. The first was those born between 1952 and 1955, who are approaching the traditional retirement age. The second group was those born in 1965 that could be arguably looked at as their successors. We gathered this information on these two groups was to ascertain if there were enough senior employees in the retirement age group to mentor those who could be their successors. \

With 90398 employees in the possible retirement group and 1549 employees in the possible successor group, the answer to our first question is a resounding yes – there will be plenty of employees to serve as mentors. As the table below shows, 57668 are senior staff and should be well equipped to mentor.

## Considerations and Possible Implications

There are other factors that need to be considered, however, other than the numbers of the situation. The first is that the average retirement age is just that – average. Some employees may prefer to work either full or part time for as long as they are physically or mentally capable. The second factor is that not all employees may want to take on either the role of mentor or the role of trainee for a new position.

While running the numbers has given us some basic insight, a deeper dive from a Human Resources perspective possibly using a survey will give a clearer picture as to how the company’s staffing may look in the next five to ten years. Strategies such as looking to promote up more junior employees and onboard entry level employees, offer part time hours or job sharing to employees that would otherwise resign or retire, and restructuring departments can all provide the flexibility in staffing that will be needed.
